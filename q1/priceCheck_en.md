There is a shop with old-style cash registers. Rather than scanning items and pulling the price from a database, the price of each item is typed in manually. This method sometimes leads to errors. Given a list of items and their correct prices, compare the prices to those entered when each item was sold. Determine the number of errors in selling prices.

### Example

products = ['eggs', 'milk', 'cheese']
productPrices = [2.89, 3.29, 5.79]
productSold = ['eggs', 'eggs', 'cheese', 'milk']
soldPrice = [2.89, 2.99, 5.97, 3.29]

| Sold Product | Sold Price	| Expected Price | Error |
|--------------|------------|----------------|-------|
| eggs 		   | 2.89 		| 2.89 			 | no 	 |
| eggs         | 2.99 		| 2.89 			 | yes 	 |
| cheese       | 5.97 		| 5.79 			 | yes 	 |
| milk         | 3.29		| 3.29 			 | no 	 |

The second sale of eggs has a wrong price, as does the sale of cheese. There are 2 errors in pricing.

### Function Description 

Write the body of the function priceCheck and the test for this function in one of the languages from the list: C, Python, Haskell or any other functional language.

The function should have the following parameters:
- string products[n]:  each products[i] is the name of an item for sale
- string productPrices[n]:  each productPrices[i] is the price of products[i]
- string productSold[m]:  each productSold[j] is the name of a product sold
- float soldPrice[m]:  each soldPrice[j] contains the sale price recorded for productSold[j].
and return:
- int: the number of sale prices that were entered incorrectly

### Constraints

- 1 ≤ n ≤ 99
- 1 ≤ m ≤ 99
- productPrices[i] ∈ products[n], where 0 ≤ i < m
- 1.00 ≤ productPrices[i], soldPrice[j] ≤ 100000.00, where 0 ≤ i < n, and 0 ≤ j < m

### Example of Function Call

priceCheck(
	products=['rice', 'sugar', 'wheat', 'cheese'],
	productPrices=[16.89, 56.92, 20.89, 345.99],
	productSold=['rice', 'cheese'],
	soldPrice=[18.99, 400.89]
) => 2

The sales of rice and cheese were at the wrong prices. So, the number of sale prices that were entered incorrectly is 2:

| Product | Actual | Expected | Error |
|---------|--------|----------|-------|
| rice 	  | 18.99  | 16.89    | yes   |
| cheese  | 400.89 | 345.99   | yes   |

You may use this example and the example in the beginning of the section as test data for your function.
